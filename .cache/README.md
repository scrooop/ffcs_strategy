# Earnings Cache Management

This directory contains the earnings date cache used by the FF scanner for fast pre-filtering. The cache eliminates 80-95% of scan runtime during heavy earnings weeks by avoiding repeated API calls.

## Cache File

**Location:** `.cache/earnings.db`
**Type:** SQLite database
**Purpose:** Persistent storage of earnings dates to avoid repeated API calls
**Size:** Typically <1 MB for 1000+ symbols

## Cache Schema

The cache uses a simple SQLite table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE earnings (
    symbol TEXT PRIMARY KEY,          -- Stock/futures symbol (e.g., 'AAPL', '/ES')
    next_earnings_date TEXT,          -- Next earnings date (YYYY-MM-DD) or NULL
    last_updated TEXT,                -- ISO timestamp of last fetch
    data_source TEXT                  -- 'yahoo' | 'tastytrade'
)
```

**Column Descriptions:**
- `symbol`: Ticker symbol (uppercase, futures with `/` prefix)
- `next_earnings_date`: Next expected earnings report date (NULL if no earnings or data unavailable)
- `last_updated`: Timestamp when this entry was last fetched from an API
- `data_source`: Which API provided this data (`yahoo` for Yahoo Finance, `tastytrade` for TastyTrade API)

## Cache Behavior

### Automatic Invalidation

The cache uses **date-based invalidation** (no TTL expiration):

- **If `next_earnings_date` is in the PAST** → Entry is stale, re-fetch from API
- **If `next_earnings_date` is in the FUTURE** → Entry is fresh, use cached value
- **If `next_earnings_date` is NULL** → Entry persists until manually refreshed

**Example:**
```
Today: 2025-10-20
Cached entry for AAPL: next_earnings_date = 2025-10-15 (past)
→ Scanner re-fetches fresh earnings date from Yahoo Finance
→ Updates cache with new date (e.g., 2025-11-05)
```

### Data Source Priority

The scanner uses a **multi-source pipeline** with graceful degradation:

1. **SQLite Cache** (instant, <10ms per symbol)
   - If entry exists and `next_earnings_date` is in future → use cached value
   - If entry stale or missing → proceed to step 2

2. **Yahoo Finance** (primary, ~100ms per symbol, 5s timeout)
   - Fetch earnings date from `yfinance` library
   - If successful → cache result and use
   - If timeout or error → proceed to step 3

3. **TastyTrade API** (fallback, ~500ms per symbol)
   - Fetch from Market Metrics API endpoint
   - If successful → cache result and use
   - If error → proceed to step 4

4. **Graceful Degradation** (fail-safe)
   - Log warning: "Could not fetch earnings for [SYMBOL]"
   - Allow symbol through filter (assume no earnings conflict)
   - Do not cache NULL results

## Manual Cache Management

### Clear Entire Cache

To force a complete refresh of all earnings data:

```bash
rm .cache/earnings.db
```

The scanner will rebuild the cache automatically on next run. This is **safe to do** and will not break anything.

**When to clear cache:**
- Cache appears corrupted (scanner errors)
- Earnings dates seem stale (though auto-refresh should handle this)
- Testing cache behavior (compare cold vs warm performance)

### Inspect Cache Contents

View the entire cache:

```bash
sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "SELECT * FROM earnings;"
```

View first 10 entries:

```bash
sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "SELECT * FROM earnings LIMIT 10;"
```

View specific symbol:

```bash
sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "SELECT * FROM earnings WHERE symbol = 'AAPL';"
```

Check for stale entries (past earnings dates):

```bash
sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "SELECT symbol, next_earnings_date FROM earnings WHERE next_earnings_date < date('now');"
```

### Cache Statistics

**Total entries:**
```bash
sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM earnings;"
```

**Breakdown by data source:**
```bash
sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "SELECT data_source, COUNT(*) FROM earnings GROUP BY data_source;"
```

**Symbols with upcoming earnings (next 30 days):**
```bash
sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "SELECT symbol, next_earnings_date FROM earnings WHERE next_earnings_date BETWEEN date('now') AND date('now', '+30 days') ORDER BY next_earnings_date;"
```

**Symbols with no earnings data:**
```bash
sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "SELECT symbol FROM earnings WHERE next_earnings_date IS NULL;"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Cache Seems Slow

**Symptoms:** Scanner takes longer than expected, low cache hit rate in console output

**Solutions:**
1. Check file size: `ls -lh .cache/earnings.db`
   - If >100 MB, something is wrong (should be <1 MB)
2. Check for database corruption:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
   ```
   - Should return `ok`
3. Clear and rebuild:
   ```bash
   rm .cache/earnings.db  # Force fresh rebuild
   ```

**Expected Performance:**
- Cache hit: <10ms per symbol
- 1000 symbols (100% cache hits): <1 second
- If slower, cache may be corrupted or on slow disk

### Problem: "Database Locked" Error

**Symptoms:** `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`

**Cause:** Multiple scanner instances accessing cache simultaneously

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait for other processes to finish** (recommended)
2. **Kill other scanner instances:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep ff_tastytrade_scanner
   kill <PID>  # Replace <PID> with process ID
   ```
3. **Delete SQLite WAL files** (if processes already terminated):
   ```bash
   rm .cache/earnings.db-wal .cache/earnings.db-shm
   ```

**Prevention:**
- Don't run multiple scanner instances simultaneously
- Use different cache locations if you must run parallel scans:
  ```bash
  # Scan 1
  python scripts/ff_tastytrade_scanner.py --tickers SPY ...

  # Scan 2 (different cache directory)
  mkdir -p .cache2
  # (Scanner doesn't support custom cache path yet - just wait for Scan 1 to finish)
  ```

### Problem: Stale Earnings Dates

**Symptoms:** Past earnings dates still showing in CSV output

**Expected Behavior:**
- Cache **should** auto-refresh when dates pass
- Scanner checks `if next_earnings_date < today: re-fetch`

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify auto-refresh is working:**
   - Check console logs for "Re-fetching earnings for [SYMBOL]"
   - If you don't see these logs, cache invalidation may be broken

2. **Manual refresh:**
   ```bash
   rm .cache/earnings.db  # Force re-fetch all earnings from APIs
   ```

3. **Check specific symbol:**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "SELECT * FROM earnings WHERE symbol = 'AAPL';"
   ```
   - Compare `next_earnings_date` to today's date
   - If date is past but entry is still in cache, auto-refresh may be broken

### Problem: Cache Directory Doesn't Exist

**Symptoms:** Scanner logs "Could not create cache directory"

**Cause:** Permissions issue or parent directory doesn't exist

**Solution:**
```bash
mkdir -p .cache
chmod 755 .cache
```

**Default Behavior:**
- Scanner creates `.cache/` automatically on first run
- If creation fails, scanner continues without cache (slower, but functional)

### Problem: Earnings Data Seems Wrong

**Symptoms:** Earnings dates in cache don't match company announcements

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Yahoo Finance data is incorrect** (rare but happens)
2. **Earnings date changed recently** (company rescheduled)
3. **Cached entry is stale** (auto-refresh didn't trigger)

**Solutions:**

1. **Check data source for specific symbol:**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "SELECT * FROM earnings WHERE symbol = 'AAPL';"
   ```
   - If `data_source = 'yahoo'`, Yahoo Finance provided this date
   - If `data_source = 'tastytrade'`, TastyTrade API provided this date

2. **Force re-fetch from TastyTrade (bypass Yahoo):**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 .cache/earnings.db "DELETE FROM earnings WHERE symbol = 'AAPL';"
   # Run scanner again - will try Yahoo first, then TastyTrade
   ```

3. **Verify against official sources:**
   - Check company's investor relations website
   - Check tastytrade platform (Market Metrics)
   - Check Yahoo Finance website

4. **Clear cache and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   rm .cache/earnings.db  # Force complete refresh
   ```

## Performance

### Cache Hit Performance

**Lookup Time:** <10 ms per symbol (average)

**Benchmarks:**
- 100 symbols (100% cache hits): <1 second
- 1000 symbols (100% cache hits): <5 seconds
- 10,000 symbols (100% cache hits): <30 seconds

**Breakdown:**
- SQLite query: ~5 ms per symbol
- Date comparison: ~1 ms per symbol
- Overhead: ~4 ms per symbol

### Cache Miss Performance

**Yahoo Finance Fetch:** ~100 ms per symbol (5s timeout)

**TastyTrade Fetch:** ~500 ms per symbol (fallback)

**Benchmarks:**
- 100 symbols (0% cache hits, all Yahoo): ~10 seconds
- 100 symbols (0% cache hits, 50% Yahoo timeout → TastyTrade): ~30 seconds
- 1000 symbols (0% cache hits, all Yahoo): <2 minutes

**Breakdown:**
- API request: 80% of time
- Network latency: 15% of time
- Cache write: 5% of time

### Real-World Performance

**Daily Scanning Workflow (typical):**

- **Day 1 (cold cache):**
  - 112 symbols: ~10 seconds
  - Cache hit rate: 0%
  - All fetches from Yahoo Finance

- **Day 2 (warm cache):**
  - 112 symbols: <1 second
  - Cache hit rate: 100%
  - All fetches from cache

- **Day 3-7 (warm cache):**
  - Same performance as Day 2
  - Cache hit rate: ~98% (2-3 symbols may have stale dates)

**Heavy Earnings Week (e.g., October):**
- **Without cache (v2.0):** 8 minutes for 1000 symbols
- **With cache (v2.1):** <30 seconds for 1000 symbols
- **Improvement:** 94% faster

## Cache Persistence

**Survives:**
- Scanner restarts
- Terminal restarts
- System reboots
- Python environment changes

**Does not survive:**
- Manual deletion (`rm .cache/earnings.db`)
- Cache directory deletion (`rm -rf .cache/`)
- File system corruption

**Recommendation:**
- Cache is disposable and rebuilds automatically
- No need to back up or version control (add `.cache/` to `.gitignore`)
