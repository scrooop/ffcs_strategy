# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Branch:** master (4 commits ahead of origin/master)

**Version:** 2.2 - Core calculation corrections for strategy alignment

**Last Updated:** October 20, 2025

## Recent Work Summary

### Completed Epics

#### 1. Core Calc Corrections Epic (COMPLETE)
**Duration:** ~4.5 hours total
**Status:** ✅ All 10 tasks complete
**Completion:** October 20, 2025

**Key Achievements:**
- ATM strike selection: 50Δ anchor (delta closest to 0.50 absolute)
- ATM FF calculation: Single `atm_ff` using averaged IVs (simplified from dual approach)
- Double calendar filtering: Added `min_ff` for conservative worst-case filtering
- Volume filtering: Hybrid system with liquidity_rating (default) and option_volume (optional)
- CSV schema: Expanded from 31 to 40 columns
- Greeks IV: Established as primary source, ex-earn IV as rare fallback

**Notable Issue Resolution:**
- Issue #32: Volume filtering initially broken (liquidity_value incorrect)
- Investigation: Found 7.8x-419x inconsistent scaling, cannot be reliable proxy
- Final solution: Hybrid filtering (liquidity_rating default, --options-volume precise mode)
- Reopened and resolved: October 20, 2025

**Completed Tasks:**
- #23 ✅ Edge Case Validation
- #25 ✅ Skip Tracking
- #28 ✅ ATM 50Δ Anchor
- #31 ✅ ATM Single FF
- #26 ✅ Double Min-Gate
- #29 ✅ Greeks IV Primary
- #32 ✅ Hybrid Volume Filtering (reopened + resolved)
- #24 ✅ CSV Schema v2.2 (40 columns)
- #27 ✅ Documentation Updates
- #30 ✅ Integration Testing

#### 2. Fast Earnings Check Epic (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Key Feature:** 80-95% runtime reduction during heavy earnings weeks

**Implementation:**
- Multi-source pipeline: Cache → Yahoo Finance → TastyTrade → Graceful degradation
- SQLite earnings cache (`.cache/earnings.db`) with automatic invalidation
- 1000 symbols: ~8 minutes → <30 seconds
- Same-day rescans: <1 second (cache hits)
- Cache hit rate: >90% for daily scanning workflows

#### 3. FF Scanner v2 Epic (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Key Features:**
- Double calendar structures (±35Δ call and put)
- Earnings detection and filtering
- Liquidity screening with configurable thresholds
- Delta tolerance controls for strike selection
- Structure selection (ATM/double/both)

### Current Epic: Output CSV Terminal Flags (IN PROGRESS)

**Epic Goals (v2.3):**
- CSV schema reduction: 40 → 32 columns (eliminate atm_* namespace)
- Professional logging with output modes (quiet/normal/verbose/debug)
- Error handling for high-volume scans (1500+ symbols)
- IV source control (--iv-ex-earn flag)

**Tasks (10 total):**
- #36 ✅ Implement --iv-ex-earn flag (COMPLETE)
- #41 ✅ Streaming CSV writer (COMPLETE)
- #37-40, #42-45: Pending

**Recent Commits:**
1. `71d6be2` - Issue #36: Add documentation and test script for --iv-ex-earn implementation
2. `5b582a8` - Issue #41: Add implementation documentation for streaming CSV writer
3. `5ad6f88` - Issue #41: Implement streaming CSV writer for memory-efficient output
4. `b18a3e1` - Prepare epic: output-csv-terminal-flags

## Outstanding Changes

### Modified Files:
- `.claude/epics/output-csv-terminal-flags/execution-status.md` - Work in progress updates

### Deleted Files (cleanup):
- `CCPM-agents.md`, `CCPM-commands.md`, `CCPM_README.md` - Old CCPM documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTEXT_ACCURACY.md`, `LOCAL_MODE.md` - Deprecated files

### Untracked Files:
- `.claude/archive/` - Archived old documentation
- `CCPM_COMPLETE_SOP.md` - Consolidated CCPM documentation

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Output CSV Terminal Flags Epic
1. Continue with Task #37: Implement logging system with output modes
2. Task #38: Error handling improvements for large scans
3. Task #39: CSV schema consolidation (40 → 32 columns)
4. Tasks #40-45: Documentation, testing, and validation

### Priority 2: Git Housekeeping
1. Review and commit/discard deleted files cleanup
2. Add `.claude/archive/` and `CCPM_COMPLETE_SOP.md` if keeping
3. Push 4 commits to origin/master

### Priority 3: Testing and Validation
1. Test --iv-ex-earn flag implementation thoroughly
2. Validate streaming CSV writer with large datasets (1500+ symbols)
3. Integration testing for v2.3 features

## Known Issues and Blockers

### Python 3.14 Asyncio Bug (WORKAROUND ACTIVE)
- **Issue:** RecursionError during asyncio cleanup with multiple DXLinkStreamer timeouts
- **Root Cause:** Python 3.14 asyncio task cancellation recursion issue
- **Workaround:** Increased recursion limit from 1000 → 10000
- **Status:** Stable workaround until Python 3.14.1+ fixes upstream
- **Reference:** https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126211

### No Critical Blockers
All major functionality is working as expected.

## Performance Metrics

### Scanner Performance:
- 112 symbols (cold cache): ~10s
- 112 symbols (warm cache): <1s
- Cache hit rate: >90% for daily scanning workflows
- Large scans (1500+ symbols): Testing in progress with streaming CSV writer

### Data Quality:
- Greeks IV coverage: >95% (primary source)
- Ex-earn IV fallback: <5% (rare fallback when Greeks missing)
- Earnings cache accuracy: 100% (multi-source validation)

## Quality Indicators

- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Documentation up to date (CLAUDE.md, README_TT.md)
- ✅ CSV schema validated (40 columns, v2.2)
- ✅ Scanner working with equities and futures
- ✅ Multi-source earnings pipeline stable
- ✅ Hybrid volume filtering operational
- ⏳ v2.3 epic in progress (20% complete - 2/10 tasks)
