# Project Vision

## Long-Term Vision

Transform FFCS Strategy from a personal CLI scanner into a **comprehensive options volatility analytics platform** that helps traders identify, execute, and manage calendar spread opportunities with institutional-grade precision and automation.

## Strategic Direction
