# Task 002: Implement Skip Tracking & Logging

## Description

Add skip reason tracking to CSV output and enhance logging to show why symbols were skipped during scans. Provides transparency for filtering decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add `skip_reason` column to CSV schema (empty string if not skipped)
- [ ] Define skip reason values: "nonpositive_fwd_var", "missing_iv", "expiry_mismatch", "volume_too_low", "delta_not_found"
- [ ] Update CSV write functions to include skip_reason field
- [ ] Add debug logging for each skip decision (symbol, structure, reason)
- [ ] Add summary statistics at end of scan: "Scanned X symbols, Y passed filters, Z skipped"
- [ ] Break down skip counts by reason in summary
- [ ] Debug mode (--debug flag) shows detailed skip decisions

## Technical Details

- **File:** scripts/ff_tastytrade_scanner.py
- Modify CSV output dataclass/dict to include skip_reason
- Add logging statements at each skip point
- Aggregate skip stats during scan loop

## Dependencies

- Task 001 (validation function provides skip reasons)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** XS
- **Hours:** 2-3
- **Parallel:** false (depends on Task 001)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] skip_reason column added to CSV
- [ ] All skip points logged with reason
- [ ] Summary statistics implemented
- [ ] Debug mode tested
- [ ] Documentation updated with skip reasons
