# Task 002: Implement Skip Tracking & Logging

## Description

Add skip reason tracking to CSV output and enhance logging to show why symbols were skipped during scans. Provides transparency for filtering decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add `skip_reason` column to CSV schema (empty string if not skipped)
- [x] Define skip reason values: "nonpositive_fwd_var", "missing_iv", "expiry_mismatch", "volume_too_low", "delta_not_found"
- [x] Update CSV write functions to include skip_reason field
- [x] Add debug logging for each skip decision (symbol, structure, reason)
- [x] Add summary statistics at end of scan: "Scanned X symbols, Y passed filters, Z skipped"
- [x] Break down skip counts by reason in summary
- [x] Debug mode (--debug flag) shows detailed skip decisions

## Technical Details

- **File:** scripts/ff_tastytrade_scanner.py
- Modify CSV output dataclass/dict to include skip_reason
- Add logging statements at each skip point
- Aggregate skip stats during scan loop

## Dependencies

- Task 001 (validation function provides skip reasons)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** XS
- **Hours:** 2-3
- **Parallel:** false (depends on Task 001)

## Definition of Done

- [x] skip_reason column added to CSV
- [x] All skip points logged with reason
- [x] Summary statistics implemented
- [x] Debug mode tested
- [x] Documentation updated with skip reasons

## Completion Notes

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-20
**Commit:** a10def9

**Implementation:**
- 10 skip reason constants defined
- CSV schema extended to 32 columns (added skip_reason)
- validate_ff_inputs() integrated before all FF calculations
- Debug logging at all skip points
- Scan summary with statistics printed to stderr
- scan() return signature updated to tuple: (rows, skip_stats, scanned, passed)
