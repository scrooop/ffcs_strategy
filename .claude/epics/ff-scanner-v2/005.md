# Task: X-earn IV Integration

## Description
Attempt to extract X-earn IV (earnings-removed implied volatility) from tastytrade Market Metrics API for more accurate Forward Factor calculations. Implement graceful fallback to dxFeed Greeks IV if X-earn data unavailable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `extract_xearn_iv()` function extracts X-earn IV from MarketMetricInfo
- [x] Function tries to get IV from `option_expiration_implied_volatilities` field
- [x] Falls back to Greeks IV if X-earn IV unavailable
- [x] CLI flags implemented: `--use-xearn-iv` (default), `--force-greeks-iv`
- [x] `iv_source` tracking added to results (values: "xearn" or "greeks")
- [x] Warning logged when X-earn IV unavailable

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
def extract_xearn_iv(
    metrics: Dict[str, MarketMetricInfo],
    symbol: str,
    expiration_date: date
) -> Optional[float]:
    """
    Try to extract X-earn IV from MarketMetricInfo.option_expiration_implied_volatilities.
    Returns None if unavailable.
    """
```

**Decision Point:** End of Week 1
- Test with 5-10 symbols to validate X-earn IV availability
- If unavailable for all symbols → disable feature, defer to v2.1
- If available → full integration and CSV tracking

**Files Affected:**
- `scripts/ff_tastytrade_scanner.py` - Add `extract_xearn_iv()` function
- Main scanning loop - Call before `snapshot_greeks()`
- CLI argument parser - Add X-earn IV flags

**Key Considerations:**
- X-earn IV availability uncertain (40% risk per PRD)
- Must maintain backward compatibility (Greeks IV is default fallback)
- Track source in CSV for post-hoc analysis
- If feature doesn't work, rely on earnings filtering (Task 001) instead

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 001 recommended (market metrics fetching) but not required
- [x] tastytrade SDK market metrics API access

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside Tasks 001-004)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code implemented with fallback logic
- [x] Function docstring with type hints
- [x] CLI flags functional
- [ ] Manual testing: Validate X-earn IV data quality on 10 symbols (PENDING - awaiting API test)
- [ ] Decision made: ship feature or defer to v2.1 (DEFERRED - needs live testing)
- [x] Warning messages logged appropriately
- [x] iv_source tracked for each result

## Implementation Summary

**Commit:** bc50b12 (combined with Issue #3)

**Changes:**
- Added `extract_xearn_iv()` function (lines 281-326)
  - Extracts X-earn IV from `option_expiration_implied_volatilities`
  - Graceful fallback when data unavailable
  - Matches expiration date before returning IV
- Updated `scan()` function (lines 403-447)
  - Tries X-earn IV first for each target DTE
  - Falls back to Greeks IV snapshot if unavailable
  - Tracks `iv_source` per target ("xearn" or "greeks")
  - INFO messages logged when falling back
- Added CLI flags (lines 524-528)
  - `--use-xearn-iv` (default: True)
  - `--force-greeks-iv` (force Greeks IV)
- Added CSV column (line 485)
  - `iv_source` field tracks data source

**Testing:**
- Syntax check: ✅
- CLI flags verified: ✅
- Live API test: ⏳ PENDING (awaiting non-rate-limited session)

**Decision Point:**
- PRD noted 40% risk that X-earn IV data may be unavailable
- Need to test with 5-10 symbols to validate availability
- If unavailable → rely on earnings filtering (Issue #2) instead

**Status:** ✅ CODE COMPLETE - Awaiting live testing to validate X-earn IV availability
