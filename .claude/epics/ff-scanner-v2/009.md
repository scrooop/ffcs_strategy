# Task: Documentation Updates

## Description
Update all project documentation to reflect v2.0 features, including CLAUDE.md, scripts/README_TT.md, and comprehensive function docstrings. Ensure new users can run scanner with all features without external guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` updated with v2.0 features and usage examples
- [ ] `scripts/README_TT.md` rewritten with new CLI examples
- [ ] All new functions have comprehensive docstrings with type hints
- [ ] `docs/gpt-setup-instructions1.txt` updated with v2.0 usage (if applicable)
- [ ] Example commands from PRD Appendix C added to README
- [ ] Feature limitations documented (e.g., if X-earn IV deferred)

## Technical Details

**CLAUDE.md Updates:**
- Add v2.0 feature overview section
- Update "Running the Scanner" with new flags
- Add thresholds section (earnings, liquidity, delta tolerance)
- Document decision made on X-earn IV (shipped or deferred)
- Update "Strategy Implementation Notes" if needed

**scripts/README_TT.md Updates:**
- Rewrite "Basic Usage" section with v2.0 examples
- Add "Command Line Flags" section with all flags documented
- Add "Feature Details" sections:
  - Earnings Filtering
  - Liquidity Screening
  - X-earn IV Support (if shipped)
  - Double Calendar Structures
- Include example output CSV with new columns
- Add troubleshooting section (common issues)

**Function Docstrings (Add to all new functions):**
```python
async def fetch_market_metrics(session: Session, symbols: List[str]) -> Dict[str, MarketMetricInfo]:
    """
    Batch fetch earnings and liquidity data for all symbols.

    Args:
        session: Active tastytrade session
        symbols: List of ticker symbols (e.g., ['SPY', 'QQQ'])

    Returns:
        Dict mapping symbol â†’ MarketMetricInfo

    Raises:
        None (returns empty dict on failure, logs error)
    """
```

**Files to Update:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview and usage
- `scripts/README_TT.md` - Scanner-specific documentation
- `docs/gpt-setup-instructions1.txt` - Quick reference (if still relevant)
- All new functions in `scripts/ff_tastytrade_scanner.py`

**Key Considerations:**
- Documentation should enable zero-knowledge new user to run scanner
- Include real examples from PRD Appendix C
- Document limitations honestly (e.g., X-earn IV unavailable)
- Keep CLAUDE.md concise, README detailed

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 001-007 completed (all features implemented)
- [ ] Can run in parallel with Task 008 (testing)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (can write docs while testing runs)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated and accurate
- [ ] README_TT.md comprehensive with examples
- [ ] All functions have docstrings with type hints
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for clarity
- [ ] New user can run scanner from docs alone (no external help)
- [ ] Limitations clearly documented
