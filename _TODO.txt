1. Verify that --show-all-scans is functioning as it's intended to

2. Move the earnings_date and liq_rating columns immediately after the _______ column

3. What exactly causes a skip to occur due to "both_legs_reqired"? Why would the following two terminal output lines be printed one after another, with one CNC double calendar being skipped for this uninformative reason and then the same symbol returning a passing double calendar??:
"2025-10-20 21:55:53,433 - scanner.greeks - DEBUG - CNC double 30-60: Skipping - both_legs_required
2025-10-20 21:55:53,433 - scanner.greeks - INFO - CNC: PASS - Double calendar (min_ff=0.349, 30-90 DTE)"

4. Update --verbose and --debug flags to work properly with the new rich-formatted terminal output. Currently they output raw log messages that don't match the clean rich formatting style.




OTHER:

- print yfinance HTTP Error 404 messages gracefully/minimally
- implement logging (tee)
- make nice terminal output formatting (spacing, real-time progress percentage?)
- print every symbol as it is processed?
- clean up horrendous terminal output, e.g.:
