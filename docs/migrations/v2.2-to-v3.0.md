# Migration notes: v2.2 → v3.0

- **CSV refactor:** 40 → **32** columns (removed redundant/intermediate fields; stabilized names).
- **Logging:** standardized levels and condensed terminal output.
- **Docs:** moved long tutorials/benchmarks out of `CLAUDE.md` into `docs/`.

If downstream tools depend on removed/renamed fields, document the mapping here.
