# Strategy primer: Forward‑Factor Calendar Spreads

- **Forward IV** (between expirations T1/T2) is derived via variance decomposition from their term vols.
- **Forward Factor (FF)** quantifies how much the front term is “rich” vs the forward: `FF = (Front_IV − Forward_IV)/Forward_IV`.
- Elevated FF can signal attractive **calendar spread** setups (ATM or double calendars).

This primer intentionally remains brief. For deeper education (thresholds, case studies, risk notes), add separate pages in this directory and keep `CLAUDE.md` small.
